    Welcome, young scholar, to our ancient Great Library, where the flow of time has
    woven together threads of knowledge through the centuries. Here, you shall delve
    into the noble art of topography, where each brushstroke brings life to unkown
    lands and forgotten paths.

        <li>Go to Canvas and draw the terrain. Choose which terrain on the right
        side. Drag the window by moving the mouse to the edge.</li>
        <li>Inspect the world map</li>
        <li>Go to Scenario and click "Generate" to randomise a game table
            according to your selected parameters. If Window is white try

        To get the true majestic feeling of a tabletop wargame, everything must be
        extravagant. The armies must be well painted must most importantly, the
        terrain must be spot on. Too often we see two extraordinary well painted
        armies battle against each other on a battlefield with only a few terrain
        pieces. This is a pity, because terrain form not around armies, but armies
        must adapt to the terrain.

        This program is a map editor to create a true large scale world, full of
        detail, in which battles can be fought. When playing a table top wargame,
        use the Scenario Generator to set the criteria, and it will then find the
        perfect spot of the battle from the map that you created yourself.
